# Soil-Moisture
This tutorial explains how to create a Soil Moisture (gatorsoil) sensor and display its values on an LCD screen using Arduino Uno

## Parts:
- Gatorsoil sensor
- LCD + I2C Backpack
- 3 alligator clips
- LCD1602
- Arduino Uno
- Jumper wires

## Download and Install
- Download and unzip the Soil-Moisture.zip file by clicking the green Clone or Download button above and selecting Download ZIP
- Unzip this file; all the files you'll need will be contained inside
- Unzip the LiquidCrystal_I2C.zip file, and drag the subsequent LiquidCrystal_I2C-1.1.2 FOLDER to the Documents/Arduino/libraries folder. - This will install the necessary library in the Arduino IDE

## Create Arduino Circuit
- Open the **Soil_Moisture_bb.pdf** file and follow the visual pinout instructions to create your circuit

## IDE Code
- Double click the **Soil_Moisture.ino** file, and say yes to the Arduino IDE pop-up window
- The file should open directly in your Arduino IDE application
- Click the Compile button to be sure the code has no bugs, then plug in your Arduino circuit and Upload the code
